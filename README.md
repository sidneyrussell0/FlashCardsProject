# Flash Cards Project
## About
This is a Codecademy Project designed to show my skills of Redux and the Redux Toolkit to finish the build of a flashcard quiz app.

## Project Goals
This app will allow users to:

- create their own topics
- create quizzes for those topics
- create flashcards for those quizzes

Users will then be able to interact with the app by flipping over flashcards for the individual quizzes.

## To Run
Run `npm start` in the project root and the app will be available on port 3000.
